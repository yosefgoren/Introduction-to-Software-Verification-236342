# Introduction to Software Verification - 236342

This repository contains homework assignments and their solutions for the course "Introduction to Software Verification" (236342) that was given in Winter 2022 semester at the Technion Institute of Technology.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each homework assignment. Each folder contains:

- A LaTeX file (`main.tex`) with the theoretical part of the assignment.
- Python and/or C files with the practical coding tasks.

## Setup

To work with the LaTeX files, it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension. You will also need to have a TeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live on Linux).

## Assignments

Each assignment folder contains specific tasks related to software verification. The tasks involve both theoretical work (proving correctness, etc.) and practical coding tasks (implementing algorithms, etc.).

## Usage

To view the assignments, navigate to the respective assignment folder and open the `main.tex` file. To run the code, navigate to the respective assignment folder and run the Python or C files.
